Learn Computational Thinking using the London Underground

RailCode teaches Computational Thinking (i.e: the basics of programming without being restricted to a particular programming language) in a rather unique way: the London Underground.

The rationale for this is simple. Programming is fun. But to someone who has never programmed before, programming may seem scary, not fun. RailCode introduces programming in a game-like format, allowing people to program without even realising that they are programming!
